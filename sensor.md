##coordinate 

###world coordinate 

X is defined as the vector product Y.Z (It is tangential to the ground at the device's current location and roughly points East).

Y is tangential to the ground at the device's current location and points towards the magnetic North Pole.

Z points towards the sky and is perpendicular to the ground.

###[Sensor Coordinate System](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/sensors/sensors_overview.html#sensors-coords)



###device /sensor / screen coordinate

In general, the sensor framework uses a standard 3-axis coordinate system to express data values. For most sensors, the coordinate system is defined **relative to the device's screen** when the device is held in its default orientation (see figure 1). When a device is held in its default orientation, the X axis is horizontal and points to the right, the Y axis is vertical and points up, and the Z axis points toward the outside of the screen face. In this system, coordinates behind the screen have negative Z values. This coordinate system is used by the following sensors:

* Acceleration sensor
* Gravity sensor
* Gyroscope
* Linear acceleration sensor
* Geomagnetic field senso


The most important point to understand about this coordinate system is that the axes are not swapped when the device's screen orientation changesâ€”that is, the sensor's coordinate system never changes as the device moves.

####[SensorManager.getOrientation(float[] R, float[] values)](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/SensorManager.html)

* values[0]: azimuth, rotation around the Z axis.
* values[1]: pitch, rotation around the X axis.
* values[2]: roll, rotation around the Y axis.

As you can see, the positive X-axis extends out of the right side of the phone, positive Y-axis extends out of the top side, and the positive Z-axis extends out of the front face of the phone. This is independent of the orientation of the phone.

**Definition of Azimuth, Pitch, and Roll**

Azimuth is angle between the positive Y-axis and magnetic north and its range is between 0 and 360 degrees.

Positive Pitch is defined when the phone starts by laying flat on a table and the positive Z-axis begins to tilt towards the positive Y-axis.

Positive Roll is defined when the phone starts by laying flat on a table and the positive Z-axis begins to tilt towards the positive X-axis.
